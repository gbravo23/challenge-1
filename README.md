# challenge-1

The purpose of this assignment was to refactor a website and improve the website's accessibility. I changed the <div> tags to tags used in semantic HTML. I followed the semantic structure of the HTML elements and included comments before each element or section of the page. The <div> tags I replaced with header, section, article tags to fullfil the semantic html requirement. The header tag was used at the top of the website to display the begining of the webpage "Horiseon". The nav tags were used as a navigation bar to display the 3 main services offered by Horiseon which were "Search Engine Optimization", "Online Reputation Management" and "Social Media Marketing". The section tags were used to define a section in the webpage and the article tags were used to specify independent, self-contained content inside the section.
